    <p>It's possible to constructe HTML pages + vue-github components to
    dynamically represent the state of a "roadmap" as seen across multiple
    GitHub projects (aka repos).</p>

      <p>This is a smart list of all a bunch of what we are currently working on, finished, and will work on in the 
        future. It's a great place to get a sense of what's going on at Hypothes.is. The items in this list are pulled 
        directly from github, and are organized into Current, Future, and Completed. If you can't find the feature you think we should be working on here, do not dismay! Feel free to <a href="">contact us</a> or perhaps checkout our <a href="">github repository</a> for a more complete list.</p>

        <!-- <h2 class="ui header">Filters</h2> -->
        <p>Since the list is large, here are a bunch of filters to help you sort through it (simply click on one to apply it):</p>

          <p>At Hypothes.is we organize our code into milestones to figure out what is most important for us to work on. Shown below is our current milestone, and the one we are planning to tackle next. The progress bars indicate what percentage of the issues in the milestone have been complete!</p>
          <!-- We should add progress bars for the milestones, and also put some clarifying text in front of the due date. "Due:" should be sufficient. -->
